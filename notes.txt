--WEEK ONE--

Project is using "Expo CLI" 
-understand what that is

Use 'expo start" to load local server

Use 'expo install' to install additional React Native/Expo packages 

React-navigation

flat list uses lazy loading
flat list loads an array of items
flat list is more 

scroll view everything is loaded

react native elements is pre styled components (similar to bootstrap)

react navigation
	stack navigator - navigation where we can nest our screens (has back button to go back in stack)
	Drawer navigatorv - the side bar that slides to the left.
	Bottom drawer -

<Text> is always needed to display text

dont style the actual component for where to place it, style the screen its going in.

theres is a component folder and then a screen folder where screens are made to display the components
navigators get their own folder as well
